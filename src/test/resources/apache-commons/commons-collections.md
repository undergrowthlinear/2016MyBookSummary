- MapUtils
- BagUtils
- Bag
  - Defines a collection that counts the number of times an object appears in the collection.
- Transformer
  - Defines a functor interface implemented by classes that transform one object into another.
- Predicate
  - Defines a functor interface implemented by classes that perform a predicate test on an object.
## 测试
- org.apache.commons.collections4.CollectionUtilsTest
  - getCardinalityMap
      - Returns a {@link Map} mapping each unique element in the given {@link Collection} to an {@link Integer} representing the number of occurrences of that element in the {@link Collection}.
  - containsAll
      - Returns <code>true</code> iff all elements of {@code coll2} are also contained in {@code coll1}. The cardinality of values in {@code coll2} is not taken into account,which is the same behavior as {@link Collection#containsAll(Collection)}.
  - union/intersection/subtract
  - transform
      - Transform the collection by applying a Transformer to each element
    - This routine is best for Lists, for which set() is used to do the transformations "in place." For other Collections, clear() and addAll() are used to replace elements.
  - collect
      - Returns a new Collection containing all elements of the input collection transformed by the given transformer.
  - select
      - Selects all elements from input collection which match the given predicate into an output collection.
  - filter
      - Filter the collection by applying a Predicate to each element. If the predicate returns false, remove the element.
  - collate
      - merges two sorted Collections, a and b, into a single, sorted List such that the natural ordering of the elements is retained.
