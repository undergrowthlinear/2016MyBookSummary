# apache-comnons系列之commons-codec1.11 学习笔记
## 概述
- Base64
  - Provides Base64 encoding and decoding as defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</a>.
- DigestUtils
  - Operations to simplify common {@link java.security.MessageDigest} tasks.
  - This class is immutable and thread-safe.
  - However the MessageDigest instances it creates generally won't be.
- MessageDigestAlgorithms
  - Standard {@link MessageDigest} algorithm names from the <cite>Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation</cite>.
- URLCodec
  - Implements the 'www-form-urlencoded' encoding scheme, also misleadingly known as URL encoding.
  - This class is thread-safe since 1.11
- Encoder
  - Provides the highest level of abstraction for Encoders
- Decoder
  - Provides the highest level of abstraction for Decoders
## 测试
- org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64Test
    - encodeBase64String
      - A-Z/a-z/0-9/-_
      - They are formed by taking a block of 3 octets to form a 24-bit string,which is converted into 4 BASE64 characters.
    - decodeBase64
      - Decodes a Base64 String into octets.
- org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtilsTest
    - md5Hex
      - Calculates the MD5 digest and returns the value as a 32 character hex string.
    - sha1Hex
      - Calculates the SHA-1 digest and returns the value as a hex string.
    - digestAsHex
      - Reads through a byte array and returns the digest for the data.
- org.apache.commons.codec.net.URLCodecTest
    - ESCAPE_CHAR = '%'
    - encode
      - Encodes a string into its URL safe form using the specified string charset. Unsafe characters are escaped.
    - decode
      - Decodes a URL safe string into its original form using the specified encoding. Escaped characters are converted back to their original representation
