        Isn't that awesome? After just two tries, we happened to get 
        a floating-point value of 0. 

        Of course, it didn't just happen. Here is how to get the seed.
        The random number generator computes 
           next(s) = s * m + a % N
        where m = 25214903917, a = 11, and N = 2^48. 
        The inverse of m mod N is v = 246154705703781, and therefore 
           prev(s) = (s - a) * v mod N
        To make a double, next is called twice, and the top 26 and 27 
        bit are taken each time. When s is 0, next(s) is 11, so that's 
        what we want to hit: two consecutive numbers whose top bits are
        zero. Now, working backwards, we start with
           s = prev(prev(prev(0))
        Almost there--the Random constructor sets 
           s = (initialSeed ^ m) % N,
        so we need to offer it
           s = prev(prev(prev(0)) ^ m = 164311266871034
